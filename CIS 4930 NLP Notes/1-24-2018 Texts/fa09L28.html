<h3>Fall 2009 Lecture 28</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>Date
 <dd>October 30, 2009
 <br><br>

 <dt>Topics (Chapters 4 and 5)
 <dd>Review Exercises
 <dd>Review *Topics* Lists from lectures 16 through 29
 <dd>We have begun to discuss three things: <i>overloading</i>, <i>recursion</i>, and <i>UML</i> and 
     have not yet completed our discussion of these topics.  Therefore they will <b>not</b> be tested 
     on Exam II.
 <dd>
 <dd>The discussion of *Code Walkthroughs* (Chapter 6.8 and 6.9) is useful in 
     understanding techniques for debugging program solutions.  It will also be 
     useful in your studying.  However, during Exam II this is not material that 
     you will be asked questions regarding.
