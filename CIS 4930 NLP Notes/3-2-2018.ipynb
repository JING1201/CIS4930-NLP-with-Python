    "    - word distance is counting the tokens in between the subject and the direct object (ex. we and door)\n",

    "    - H0: What should be true if w1 s2 do not form a collocation (can reverse depends on how we calculate)\n",
    "    - Compute the probability p that a word pair event would occur if H0 were true\n",
    "    - accept H0 if p is high, reject H0 is p is low\n",
    "    - p < 0.05\n",
    "    - the lower p indicates that w1 w2 clustering is not just a random event\n",
